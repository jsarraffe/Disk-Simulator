LIST OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE HELPED ME

Guy Greenleaf:  
- Guy and I were both in tutoring, and I was confused about how the r/w head would affect add_request in STqueue. He screenshared with me, and drew out what would happen given a certain r/w head, and request for a certain queue, which then led to my understanding of the project.


Ali Kooshesh:

- Drastically cut the amount of code in my pickup function, when he recommended I add a helper for function for request that get added to the head, basically request thats track
is between the r/w head and the heads track.

- While I had Clook almost done, their was one bug that kept driving me crazy I also had like 90+ lines of code. He showed a more compact way, and easier way to implement CLook. Using curr and next, as linked list, and one helper function I was able to solve the problem more efficiently and with less code than my previous example. Thank you very much once again, that made my life a lot easier.

Unfortunately I have not helped anyone on this project.

NO CODE WAS COPIED OR TAKEN FROM A WEBSITE.

I have implemented all features part of the project requirements.
